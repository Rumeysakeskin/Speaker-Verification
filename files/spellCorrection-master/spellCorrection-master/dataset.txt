the <ERR targ=sidecar> side care </ERR> man was alright but the <ERR targ=motorbike> motor bike </ERR> Rider was thrown into the crowd
I <ERR targ=don't> dont </ERR> <ERR targ=know> no </ERR> what <ERR targ=happened> hapend </ERR> to him
he was <ERR targ=hurt> heart </ERR> quite bad.

his hat was blowing down the track
the <ERR targ=motorbike> moter bike </ERR> <ERR targ=caught> caugh </ERR> fire and <ERR targ=blew> blow </ERR> up

The End 

we went over the football field it was quite wet and soon made my toes cold.
the grass was quite long now it <ERR targ=shone> shon </ERR> with the dew on it.
a field <ERR targ=ploughed> ploud </ERR> next to it I think it was <ERR targ=done> don </ERR> yesterday.
on the other side was <ERR targ=a> an </ERR> hedge
it had a lot of thorns in it .
they <ERR targ=had> hade </ERR> <ERR targ=cleaned> cleand </ERR> the river and made it very wide <ERR targ=for> fore </ERR> the ducks
there were some <ERR targ=potatoes> potato </ERR> in the water .
there were some brussels men sitting in the <ERR targ=pathway> parth way </ERR> round a fire
we had to go on to a <ERR targ=ploughed> ploud </ERR> field to get round them this made my shoes <ERR targ=heavy> hevey </ERR> .
this was quite muddy
some boys did not think much to it nor did I but we still went.
the dew on the brussels leaves made them <ERR targ=like> look </ERR> <ERR targ=pearls> pirls </ERR> .
Mr. Holbrook went over the brook first
some were boys going round but only one went
after all the rest went over the tree Gerald <ERR targ=nearly> nealy </ERR> went in
one foot <ERR targ=touched> toch </ERR> the water
then we went across the new <ERR targ=piece> pice </ERR> of grass into school
we went and <ERR targ=cleaned> cleand </ERR> our shoes with paper
then the bell went for <ERR targ=break> brack </ERR> .

He was <ERR targ=too> to </ERR> young to to understand he was crying all the time <ERR targ=nevertheless> never the less </ERR> .

 It happened to me When I was 4 years old I very nearly <ERR targ=died> diad </ERR> .
It was one sunday when my 3 older sisters and I were out for a walk I had my photo taken near a brook.
I still have the photo.
The brook was about 8 feet wide.
The water was about 2 feet deep.
But <ERR targ=there> they </ERR> was 6 feet <ERR targ=of> off </ERR> wet slimy mud I was the first to cross the bridge it broke and in I went.
I <ERR targ=slowly> slolly </ERR> sank in the mud my 2 youngest sisters ran home but my oldest sister <ERR targ=stopped> stoped </ERR> and saved my life she held my head above water <ERR targ=until> untill </ERR> my sisters got home and told my parents.
then they raced down to the brook dad <ERR targ=had> have </ERR> a hell of a Job pulling me out as the mud held me down eventually <ERR targ=he> his </ERR> got me out and <ERR targ=carried> carred </ERR> me home.
my clothes had to <ERR targ=be> me </ERR> <ERR targ=destroyed> distrod </ERR> it took seven <ERR targ=baths> bath </ERR> to get me <ERR targ=clean> clearn </ERR> .

 <ERR targ=I'm> Im </ERR> am never <ERR targ=allowed> alloud </ERR> to sit up and watch <ERR targ=programmes> programes </ERR> not <ERR targ=suitable> surtebull </ERR> for children one night when dad was digging the garden mum had gone out, <ERR targ=there> they </ERR> was a film on TV <ERR targ=unfit> unfitt </ERR> for children I sat and watched it, it was all murder and killing, men were being hung and <ERR targ=others> other </ERR> were being shot or <ERR targ=stabbed> stabed </ERR> .
men had their heads cut in half .

 My work on a farm I have live on a farm all <ERR targ=of> off </ERR> my life, I am not <ERR targ=boasting> bosting </ERR> but I think I know a fair bit about farming.
I know most about cattle and only a little about machinery.
Some people say farming is the lowest <ERR targ=paid> payed </ERR> and hardest working <ERR targ=employment> imployment </ERR> out.
I agree with those people.
but I would rather work for my living, than just <ERR targ=sitting> siting </ERR> in a <ERR targ=stuffy> stufy </ERR> old office adding up numbers all day or whatever they do.
Give me the open air life.
My father is a farm stockman and I hope to take on the same Job when I leave school.
I am going to take my <ERR targ=apprenticeship> apprentiship </ERR> course when I leave at easter.
that means that I go to <ERR targ=classes> classis </ERR> <ERR targ=once> ones </ERR> a week.
I will learn a lot more about farming and if I pull through the course I will be a <ERR targ=useful> usfull </ERR> chap about the farm.
<ERR targ=While> Will </ERR> I am taking my course I will be <ERR targ=getting> get </ERR> 17 <ERR targ=shillings> shilling </ERR> less than the boy worker that is not taking the course.
But when I am 17 and finished my <ERR targ=Apprenticeship> Apprentiship </ERR> I will get 10% more than the average pay <ERR targ=of> off </ERR> a boy my age.
Many people asked me why I have <ERR targ=chosen> choosen </ERR> farming as my future <ERR targ=career> carrer </ERR> .
(1) I will be in the open air.
(2) I will be doing a <ERR targ=different> diffrent </ERR> Job every day (3) I am not interested in <ERR targ=anything> enthing </ERR> else.
For the last 2 or 3 years I am have been <ERR targ=working> work </ERR> on the farm in the holidays.
And I can tell the men I have worked with have been good and <ERR targ=given> give </ERR> me a few tips.
my dad has told quite a lot about farming which I know will help when I <ERR targ=leave> life </ERR> school.
So if anybody <ERR targ=wants> want </ERR> an open air life, choose FARMING

 When a woman looks in her Pram
One day a young woman went down the street to do her shopping.
She went into the shop to order her weekly meat, of course she left her baby <ERR targ=outside> out side </ERR> the shop.
Her baby was still sitting her its pram, but the little baby was crying.
the little baby could not talk much he could say little words.
<ERR targ=His> He's </ERR> Mum said to him "Now what are you crying for My little baby, "he keep on "Man, Man,", he <ERR targ=meant> mean't </ERR> that Man which were going down the road, at first she could not understand him you see this man had a black baby in a blue pram And a woman came over the road <ERR targ=and> a </ERR> said "you better watch <ERR targ=where> were </ERR> you leave <ERR targ=your> you </ERR> baby misses." the baby's <ERR targ=mother> mothers </ERR> said "why" so the other lady" said, "because you know that old man which <ERR targ=has> as </ERR> Just gone down the road, well he tried to take your little baby out of <ERR targ=its> it's </ERR> pram.
So she said "thank you very much for telling me, and said "goodbye So the lady <ERR targ=walked> walk </ERR> on with her baby.
This time she went into the baker's to get some bread.
The old man with the baby was outside the fishmonger, which was just aside the  baker's.
The Lady went in, and while she was in the man changed <ERR targ=babies> babys </ERR> .
So he had the white one and she had the black one, of course he ran away, no one saw him.
She came out of the Baker's and looked in her pram a saw the baby asleep.
She went home <ERR targ=and> a </ERR> while the baby was <ERR targ=asleep> a sleep </ERR> she done some jobs.
When she had done her jobs she said to herself "the <ERR targ=baby> babys </ERR> is having a long sleep.
I go and see if he is still asleep.
She opened the <ERR targ=door> down </ERR> and she <ERR targ=saw> sow </ERR> a black baby sitting in her pram she shouted.

The police said they would be here in a very few <ERR targ=minutes> minetes </ERR> .
As soon as she had a knock on the door, she said "Come in," it was the policemen.
The police said, "What can we do for you Miss.
So she said "This is not my baby I had a white one so the police said when did you first find out she said just a minute ago.
Just before before I phoned you.
One of the police said "did you leave it <ERR targ=outside> out side </ERR> a shop, and she said "yes while I went in the  baker's .
(she was crying) The other policeman said.

 AN APPLE
It comes off of a tree when you pick it is rosy red and before you eat it makes your mouth water it even makes your mouth water when you hear the name  gascoyne's scarlet.
when you go scrumping and when you get caught it is worth taking the chance of getting some gascoyne's scarlet apples.
when you go scrumping you have got to be <ERR targ=careful> carefull </ERR> you don't get caught if you do get caught the man will be waiting for you next time you go to get some more gascoyne scarlet apples.
when I go scrumping all I go after is apples and plums, pears.
when you go pinching <ERR targ=apples> apple </ERR> you do not want to take <ERR targ=too> to </ERR> many people or you will not get away so quick when there are a lot of people with you <ERR targ=especially> a specally </ERR> little boys they make too much noise.
If you pick apples off of the ground you have to be <ERR targ=careful> carful </ERR> of the wasps or else they will sting you and the sting comes up to a big bump <ERR targ=wherever> where ever </ERR> it stings you.
when you are by yourself and <ERR targ=someone> some one </ERR> comes and you have to climb over the <ERR targ=barbed> barb </ERR> wire and get caught the man will <ERR targ=probably> probally </ERR> catch you but if someone else is with you they can unhook you.
some people when <ERR targ=they> the </ERR> catch you they might hit you and <ERR targ=say> said </ERR> he will hit you harder next time he catches you.
But some people say they will hit you next time but warn you not to come in the orchard again But the children could not resist getting some more apples to eat.
It is best getting apples from an orchard where there are no houses.
when I go scrumping I do not take bikes because the man who owns the orchard might come along and take the bikes and if you want your bike you have to go and ask for it and that is how the owner of the orchard knows that you were in the orchard.
I never take a dark jacket or a red one because you will be <ERR targ=recognized> reconnised </ERR> very easy because red shows up very easy.
But still it is worth getting some gascoyne's scarlet apples.

 The Fox The fox is a sly old beast He sits in his den cleaning and waiting To make <ERR targ=another> a nother </ERR> savage attack He walks the field to the farm The smell of chickens in the passing breeze.
he's gone to collect his meal.
He makes a leap.
Chickens cackle as the fox collects his meal.

 WINTER When the snow lay round about The robins come out to seek crumbs Their feet are numb But the snow still lies round about.
A tree is a place for song That's where birds sing their sweet song.
The leaves have gone.
It will not be long before the tree has gone.

 <ERR targ=Stranded> Stranden </ERR> on a Desert Island
One <ERR targ=midsummer> midsummer's </ERR> day at 9.30 a.m.
a ship was wrecked by a <ERR targ=coral> corral </ERR> reef so people jumped overboard.
People who could not swim did not know it was a case of life or death The ship was sinking fast but some still hung on.
the shore was only about a mile away so some began to swim to the shore.
Getting food from the ship was impossible but some people on the ship could get down to the store room and get some diving <ERR targ=outfits> out fits </ERR> .
So one man <ERR targ=volunteered> volonteered </ERR> to swim out to the ship and go down to the store room.
<ERR targ=There> Their </ERR> were dead <ERR targ=bodies> bodys </ERR> on the deck within 20 minutes of the <ERR targ=shipwreck> ship wreck </ERR> .
<ERR targ=There> Their </ERR> were 1 or 2 live people on board but he was frightened to go on the island.
The man who swam from the island went down to the store room.
He held his breath as he went down below the surface of the water.
As he <ERR targ=opened> open </ERR> the store room door the water gushed in very quickly.
So he had to feel for the diving suits.
He brought as many as he could find to the surface and that was only 5.
He got up in the crows nest and waved to the people on the island so they sent <ERR targ=two> to </ERR> men to help him.
When they arrived they all put their diving suits on <ERR targ=then> the </ERR> went down to get some food.
<ERR targ=Lucky> Luckily </ERR> enough it was mostly <ERR targ=tinned> tin </ERR> food.
They brought quite a lot up for the people on the island.
When looking around the deck they saw a <ERR targ=lifeboat> life boat </ERR> but it had a little hole in one side but they thought it would be good enough take the food to the island in.
They all had one tin of something each.
They all ate this just like pigs feeding out of a trough.
After they had their tin of food to eat people were still hungry so they started looking for coconuts.
They all decided that there would only be two meals a day.
most of them agreed but of course there were some who protested.
There was about 35 on the island but people who <ERR targ=used> use't </ERR> to get coconuts <ERR targ=usually> usally </ERR> got lost or got bitten by a snake.
They had <ERR targ=shortened> shortend </ERR> <ERR targ=down> done </ERR> from 35 to 15.
They kept near the coast so they could go in the sea if they wanted to.
And they could also catch fish to eat.
After several weeks ships had seen them waving but took no notice of them In september food was running short so they <ERR targ=killed> kill </ERR> animals and drank fresh water from springs.
they found here and there.
they found coconuts while hunting for animals.
They took the coconuts down to the shore and drained the milk out and ate the rest of the inside.
They caught quite a few tigers in traps which are holes dug in the <ERR targ=ground> gound </ERR> and sticks <ERR targ=laid> laide </ERR> across with grass on top of them.
At night they slept all together under coconut trees.
They were not surprised to see somebody dead in the morning.
One morning in december a ship was going across the sea to England they waved and waved again.
Then the ship began to turn and was coming to fetch them they were all delighted.
As soon <ERR targ=as> ass </ERR> they arrived on board the sailors told them to report to the  captain's  office.
They all too pleased to be on board a ship again the captain said how did you get on that island they replied we were shipwrecked in June and we have been there since.
They arrived in England 2 days later and how glad they were to be back in England again.

 My family
There are Eight of us in my family counting my mother and <ERR targ=Father> Farther </ERR> .
I have two sisters, one Janet one Edna.
Three brothers Terry <ERR targ=Stuart> Sturt </ERR> and <ERR targ=Geoff> Goef </ERR> .
I think my family is awful because I get blamed for <ERR targ=nearly> nely </ERR> everything if one of my brothers hit <ERR targ=anyone> any own </ERR> else I get all the blame.

 I got a bag nearly <ERR targ=full> ful </ERR> and then I <ERR targ=saw> soor </ERR> a man with a gun coming across the <ERR targ=meadow> meddow </ERR> after me, I put my bag over my shoulder and run, the old man come after me he <ERR targ=said> seid </ERR> stop or else I will blow your <ERR targ=head> hed </ERR> right off.
I said shut your gob and I took two apples out of my bag and through them at him, one hit him in the guts and hit him on the bonce, he fell <ERR targ=to> too </ERR> the ground and lay there, and I said to <ERR targ=myself> my self </ERR> <ERR targ=that's> thats </ERR> a good Job now I can eat my apples.

 LEAVING SCHOOL
When I <ERR targ=leave> leav </ERR> school I am going to work up the petrol pumps at Mr Sturgess's at Mording.
I work up there at <ERR targ=weekends> weekend </ERR> and in the holidays.
I like working up there because I meet all kinds of people.
They have a farm attached to it they keep a few pigs up the farm and a few down the road in a meadow.
They have a tractor and a trailer.
<ERR targ=There> They </ERR> are two brothers Frank and John.
John is my boss.
Frank has four cars two which go and two which do not go.
John owns the tractor and trailer and all the pigs and a cattle lorry and Frank owns one bullock one cow and one <ERR targ=heifer> effer </ERR> .

 THE FARM
When I go up the farm on saturday morning I go down the yard and start up the tractor, and back the trailer on and go up the yard, then clean the pigs out with John, then the lorry.
Then we go back down the yard and unload the dung.
Then I started the tractor up <ERR targ=again> a gain </ERR> , and went out on <ERR targ=to> too </ERR> the <ERR targ=field> fild </ERR> .
Then we <ERR targ=uncovered> an cafferd </ERR> some <ERR targ=mangels> manggles </ERR> , and loaded them up we got three <ERR targ=loads> loades </ERR> before dinner from about 11.30 until about 1. <ERR targ=o'clock> oclock </ERR> .
When we come back from dinner we started the tractor up again and went for <ERR targ=another> a nother </ERR> load, we got <ERR targ=four> for </ERR> more <ERR targ=loads> loades </ERR> before tea the last one we <ERR targ=got> go </ERR> stuck with.
But we soon got out of <ERR targ=that> theat </ERR> when John put some bricks under the wheels This is the tractor <ERR targ=which> witch </ERR> I drive at <ERR targ=weekends> week ends </ERR> , and in the holidays.
You have to start it by a handle and you have to turn the petrol on and when you get it going you have to let it warm up first and then turn it on to T.V.O.
Then away you go.
It is a low <ERR targ=geared> gird </ERR> tractor it has three <ERR targ=forward> fowd </ERR> <ERR targ=gears> girse </ERR> and 1 <ERR targ=reverse> reveirse </ERR> .
It has <ERR targ=four> for </ERR> <ERR targ=cylinders> silinders </ERR> and a <ERR targ=hydraulic> high drollit </ERR> lift. the <ERR targ=manifold> many fold </ERR> <ERR targ=has> as </ERR> burnt out so smoke and flames and sparks fly out of the <ERR targ=bottom> botton </ERR> of it.
if you fill the <ERR targ=radiator> radyator </ERR> up with water it will last for 10 minutes <ERR targ=because> becouse </ERR> it has a hole in the bottom of it as big round as a sixpence.

 The Sick Sow.
Last week I went up the farm and Bill told me that he had just bought a black and white sow.
He said it fed all right for the first three days, but now she won't feed <ERR targ=at all> a tall </ERR> .
So I said let me come and look at <ERR targ=her> here </ERR> , so we went and had a look at <ERR targ=her> here </ERR> , and she was lame on the <ERR targ=her> here </ERR> right, front leg.

 The Old Bull
One day I went round old man <ERR targ=Jones's> Joneses </ERR> farm and he and some of his <ERR targ=workmen> work men </ERR> had got the bull out in the yard.
As I went in the gate the old bull started to <ERR targ=turn> tern </ERR> on me, so old man Jones, said get behind that old cart Joe.
About 4 or 5 minutes after, I came out from behind the cart.
They had got the old bull back in the shed.
Then he asked me if I would <ERR targ=help> held </ERR> him bring daisy the old cow up to go with the old bull, because he thinks that she ought to have a nothing calf.
So he put <ERR targ=her> here </ERR> in with old Toogey the bull he got on <ERR targ=her> here </ERR> back and we let him stay with <ERR targ=her> here </ERR> <ERR targ=for> fore </ERR> about half of an hour.
About four to five month after she had been with the old bull she had a calf it was a bull calf.
When it was about ten weeks old, when we sold it it made #15.10s.6d.
Then the time came for the old bull to be sold he was <ERR targ=too> to </ERR> old and fat for the old cows.
So we took him down tonbury market and he made #85.10/6d <ERR targ=alive> alife </ERR> he <ERR targ=weighed> wade </ERR> one and a half tons.

 1.
A brown study means when <ERR targ=someone> some one </ERR> is in a sort of dream or a sulk.
2.
Fighting with your own shadow.
3.
The snow which the geese drip on the ground are feathers.
4.
To <ERR targ=grieve> greive </ERR> like a goose.

 Poor Bob
It is ten years since Bob had his accident he was a bright lad I <ERR targ=shall> she </ERR> <ERR targ=never> nether </ERR> forget when I and Bob fell into a river coming home from church on Sunday night we had got our <ERR targ=clothes> cloths </ERR> on.

 The <ERR targ=unexpected> unispected </ERR> trip across the sea
Once upon a time there was a boy named Peter.
He went to the harbour he was very tired so he saw a ship he got on board the ship, he crept down to where the cargo was kept he got in a <ERR targ=comfortable> comvatable </ERR> place to sleep.
He woke up 6 hours later he got out of the cargo store crept up on Deck and all he could see was the sea the boat had left the harbour and it was due for china.
he <ERR targ=crapped> crept </ERR> back to the cargo sat, wondering what he would do next then he <ERR targ=lay> laid </ERR> down and went to sleep again when the men came down to fetch the cargo.
They saw the boy they took him for to the captain.
Then the captain said to the boy what are you doing <ERR targ=here> hear </ERR> I run away from home I was very tired.
I see this boat so i <ERR targ=crept> creeped </ERR> on board, and had a sleep.
The <ERR targ=captain> captian </ERR> said I will let you stay <ERR targ=aboard> abroard </ERR> the ship as long as you work for your keep.
The boy said all right <ERR targ=I'll> ile </ERR> work.
The captain said go with the men to shift the cargo so he went to the cargo store they lifted all the cargo to another place, then they had to scrub the deck when they had finished that they saw china in the distance he wondered what it would be like.
The captain said it will be all right you will not go <ERR targ=off> of </ERR> this ship by next week you will be back home.
The boy said I <ERR targ=don't> dont </ERR> want to go <ERR targ=home> hime </ERR> , if I do i will get killed.
The police will see that you <ERR targ=don't> dont </ERR> get belted on December 10th they were in england, and the boy was home with his parents.

 The Rat
The rat is a dirty creature it digs tunnels under the ground at night it goes in the chicken hut looking for meal and wheat then it goes to sleep.

 The mouse
The mouse is a slimy fellow, <ERR targ=it's> its </ERR> not very big but it squeezes through tiny cracks in wood <ERR targ=it's> its </ERR> got very sharp teeth and a slimy tail and its little ears prick out of the hole it likes meal.

 The Mouse
The mouse is a little fellow it lives amongst straw and sometimes a pile of bags or in any old heaps of rubbish etc.
it makes a <ERR targ=runway> runaway </ERR> through rubbish and into meal bins where it eats the meal and soon as anybody comes, it jumps out of the meal bins along its runway and back in <ERR targ=its> is </ERR> nest .

 The hare came running down the hill With a flash of brown <ERR targ=it's> its </ERR> down the hill its Big brown ears prick out of the corn resting all day and playing all night with its little fluffy tail dragging behind that crafty old hare <ERR targ=lying> laying </ERR> in the barley 

 The 6.45 came racing down the line with a whistle and hoot <ERR targ=it's> its </ERR> flying high round the corner 85 miles an hour tearing down the hill but then the fireman shouted jump for it or you'll be a goner because <ERR targ=there> the </ERR> was a passenger train coming this way the fireman jumped out but the driver never the fireman heard a crash and a bang there was a wreck the driver was dead for he hit his head.

 The Tramp.
The tramp is a funny man He walks all over the place He sleeps under a hedge He has got a pair of baggy socks A pair of trousers with holes in it And a grubby Jacket not worth twopence He eats scraps of meat with a piece of bread Then he goes on his way Like a funny man

For the first summer holiday, I would like to go to Butlin's holiday camp.
For my children I would like a blue and white or Black pram.

 Stephen asked me if I would like to go, so he bought two tickets for him and me, and we went in and Pauline and Trevor were sitting in there holding hands.
So we went in and they called us over to go and sit with them, and we did and when the film started all the lights were put out, and it was very dark in there, then Stephen was sitting there next to me, and Pauline said go on Stephen hold Judith's hand, and after a while he did, and he didn't let go of it until the film was over.
the best boyfriend I ever had .
<ERR targ=his> he's </ERR> father was posted .
and so Stephen left.
But we still send letters and <ERR targ=postcards> post cards </ERR> to each other.
So that we still remember each other .

 One fine morning I got up, and went to bring the milk in to make some coffee, but at my disaster I found a young baby lying in a basket fast asleep, so I grabbed it quick and brought it in, it was a baby boy with light hair and blue eyes, well of course I would have loved to keep the child but I knew that wouldn't be right, so I telephoned the Police, and told them everything that had happened, and told me to take the baby down to the Police station.
So I got ready and set off to the station.
Of course I liked the baby and didn't want to give it to the Police.
They said that they would put up notices about the baby.
They let me look after him until someone owned up.
A month later.
A month went but nobody owned up and the Police were tired of looking everywhere for the parents that they said I could adopt the baby if I wanted to, if not they would put it in a home.
I soon got married and talked it over with my husband, and he said it was OK, with him so, in a few <ERR targ=days'> day's </ERR> time the baby was ours and <ERR targ=weren't> were'nt </ERR> we pleased.
So we all lived happily ever after.
The End.

 When I am a children's Nurse
When I get the Job of a children's nurse, I shall be very happy I'm sure, There will be lots of other <ERR targ=nurses> nurse's </ERR> there to help look after the children we have to put the children to bed, and get them dressed, give them <ERR targ=their> there </ERR> food, and toys to play.
I like looking after young children, I will be able to get home now and then, and see <ERR targ=my> may </ERR> parents.
If one of the children decide that they want to run away then of course we must go and look for them, and bring them back.

 IN THE SUMMER HOLIDAYS.
One day, about the second week, I was going shopping, and <ERR targ=taking> takeing </ERR> my friend for a walk.
When three boys whistled at me and they asked me to come and get a rose which they had put on their lunch bags, for me, of course I went as red as beetroot, but when I came back they called me again so after a while I went and Picked it up I started talking to them every day .

 Betty went down to the shop to get some groceries for dinner, they got 2 lb of potatoes, 1 large tin beans, and 1/2lb ham, and 1 large peaches and 1 large cream which all came to 6/- 10d, when they got home the girls cooked the meal .

 they started out and the sea got deeper, but it was lovely, the sun was shining like a star glittering at night, the sea was calm and bright, as we looked ahead at the deep deep sea, it was just like a dream which has come true .

 Because <ERR targ=it's> its </ERR> night time and dark.
Because the wind is wild.
Because the two waves are a ring.
It's where the sea has washed away The side of the rocks.
The front of the boat Where the sea ran up the beach.
Because there are trees in way There whispering to each other The sun is hot with wild animals roaming around.
The beach is so hot and the sea is calm, animals are roaming, here and there.

 They ran away to get married In a little country called Lawton was a huge house with seventeen rooms and in it lived mother, father, maids, and four children, the eldest, was Jenny who was 18 years of age, she had 3 other brothers and sisters who were all under the age of 12, Jenny had a boyfriend who <ERR targ=lived> live </ERR> a few yards <ERR targ=away> a way </ERR> from her, his name was Johnny he was 20 years of age.
Jenny and Johnny wanted to get <ERR targ=married> marreid </ERR> , they had known each other for 6 years, and were very much in love.
They had got mostly everything to start with, they had a double bed, curtains, dressing table, crockery and lots of other things to start a married home.
But <ERR targ=the> thee </ERR> only trouble was that their parents wouldn't give their consent, to the marriage.
So the two young children decided to <ERR targ=run> ran </ERR> away and get married.
So they packed a few clothes and Johnny got two tickets on a train to London they had some money in the bank about #30.
So one bright sunny morning they got up about six <ERR targ=o'clock> oclock </ERR> and made their way to the station.
they were two hours early so stayed on the platform and had some breakfast.
Soon they were on the train.
Now we needn't worry about <ERR targ=anything> anythink </ERR> my darling, said Johnny.
No we can get a job in London and live in a flat for a few months until we can get a house of our own, said Jenny.
yes then we can go back home, tell our parents, the news and get the rest of our things together and come back to London.
2 months pass They got a flat and were now thinking of getting married, so they got married  in a <ERR targ=registry> registery </ERR> office and after <ERR targ=they> the </ERR> <ERR targ=celebrated> celebrate </ERR> until 12 <ERR targ=o'clock> oclock </ERR> that night, then a week later they got tickets back to Lawton, they got home and went and rang on Jenny's doorbell first.
<ERR targ=his> he </ERR> father came to the door, and took one look and "slammed!" the door in their faces, and shouted out "I don't know where you've been, but I don't want you to lay a step inside this house, you're an absolute disgrace to our family, but dad, shouted Jenny I've only come home to tell you the news what's that he "said" I am married <ERR targ=that's> thats </ERR> why I and Johnny ran away we got married in a registry office.
so "said" her father, Oh ! well I wish you the best of luck in your marriage, but I do wish you'd told us all because I think you are old enough to be man and wife, well my daughter and son in law, welcome home.
you can live here both of you, until you get a decent place of your own, thank you dad, and thank you sir, said Johnny, don't call me sir my son, you're one of us now so, you may as well call me dad I must go and fetch <ERR targ=your> youre </ERR> parents Johnny, and we will celebrate said her father, all the family got together and celebrated.
and later they got a place of their own and a couple of years later they had twins a boy and a girl, and they all lived happily ever after.

Dear Les,
I hope you are O.K.
just a few lines to write about our English lesson with Mr Holbrook in the last 12 months.
He has taught us how to write good letters, stories, and poems.
some of the work he has taught us will be of use to us in later years.
But some work hasn't taught us a single thing, we have to learn a fair bit of English to help us as we get older, and out to work.
Love and best wishes, Judith

then it tried to get away but it was <ERR targ=no> know </ERR> use it was killed <ERR targ=then> they </ERR> they all came out and then they all were killed.
Then there was my mother and father and I came out of the house that night and saw that the cats were in the hole making a noise but we <ERR targ=couldn't> count </ERR> do anything about it because it was <ERR targ=too> to </ERR> late.
But have got over it.

 My mother and father have been married for ten years and they have been happy ever since.
When they started to meet.
They said shall we go to the pictures and my mother said yes <ERR targ=we'll> well </ERR> do that said my mother it is a very good idea.
But <ERR targ=sometimes> some times </ERR> they have a fight they had a fight last night but they made friends again then when we went out last Saturday afternoon they started to have a fight.
My father shouted at my mother and <ERR targ=then> than </ERR> my mother shouted at my father then when my father went to the meeting we went to finish our shopping .

 When the children went out to play after dinner Linda and I went on the field and sat down for a bit there were Mary Smith and Linda and I Linda said something (and then I went up to her and got on top of her and so we had a little play fight) but we are still friends with each other.
we go together every day.
I like her to come to Guildwell some day but she said no she <ERR targ=can't> cant </ERR> there if she could she would come and see me and we would have good fun together and go up to the meadow and climb trees 
 Went I went on my holiday I had a very nice time we played on the bikes and went shopping and when my Auntie went to work but when she went work Joan and Derek started to have a quarrel but I did not take no notice of them and carried on what I was doing then Joan said something to me but I did take notice of her and then she said I always <ERR targ=started> startes </ERR> a <ERR targ=quarrel> qurral </ERR> but when we were friends again.
Well on one Saturday when my Uncle <ERR targ=decided> desided </ERR> to go to the pictures with Joan and Derek well when they were in the pictures I was in a room watching Bronco Layne on T.V.
it was better than watching the film but I mean that Bronco was very good.
Well when they came home that night I was still watching the T.V.
and Derek and Joan came in and said that my Uncle was drunk and Joan said that he nearly got run over and <ERR targ=also> als </ERR> Joan had <ERR targ=guided> guard </ERR> him back to the house where was safe.
Well that same night when we were watching Deadline-midnight my Uncle came in and sat on a chair and watched part of the <ERR targ=programme> programe </ERR> and then came up and switched the T.V. <ERR targ=off> of </ERR> and <ERR targ=told> to </ERR> us to go to bed we ran <ERR targ=upstairs> up stairs </ERR> and Derek and I went into my bedroom so we stay in the room and I heard someone coming up the stairs so I went and I <ERR targ=peeped> peped </ERR> <ERR targ=outside> out side </ERR> the door and saw that my Uncle was coming up the stairs so I told Derek so we went round the bed and I got on the bed and went straight down stairs and went into the <ERR targ=kitchen> kitchin </ERR> and told my Auutie but she said that she <ERR targ=can't> cant </ERR> do anything about it so when he came <ERR targ=downstairs> down stairs </ERR> again we went <ERR targ=upstairs> up stairs </ERR> to bed.
And when I was in bed I <ERR targ=listened> lisinid </ERR> out for my Uncle because sometimes when he is drunk he comes up to my room door but not always but it stopped me from going to sleep because <ERR targ=sometimes> sometime </ERR> he gives me the <ERR targ=creeps> creaps </ERR> but before then he very nearly hit Derek and I but I <ERR targ=don't> dont </ERR> know what for and then we went to bed and went to sleep but when they all were asleep my uncle got up and came out of the room and went <ERR targ=downstairs> down stairs </ERR> I <ERR targ=don't> dont </ERR> know what he was up to but still I kept awake a very long time because I <ERR targ=wasn't> wasnt </ERR> tired so I stayed awake for a while and when he came <ERR targ=upstairs> up stairs </ERR> and stood outside my door I got a bit scared because I thought he was going to come in my room so I kept so still and quiet and a bit later he went into his own room and got in bed and went to sleep and he woke my Auntie she was awake for a little while and then she was asleep in a <ERR targ=no> know </ERR> time and I couldn't go to sleep at all but still I kept awake to listen out for my uncle just in case he came into my room but a bit later on I fell <ERR targ=off> of </ERR> to sleep and I got nice and warm.

 Sir,
Mr. T. says Mr. Holbrook is <ERR targ=too> to </ERR> soft with us by not teaching us spellings.
I agree with Mr t because you <ERR targ=cannot> can not </ERR> write a good story without knowing how to spell, I am the best speller in 3c and do not find some words <ERR targ=difficult> differcult </ERR> but people who get under 40 find words very <ERR targ=difficult> differcult </ERR> .
If you do not practise writing letters you will find it very hard when you leave school.
I think Mr Holbrook has difficulty in reading our stories if we do not write neatly so I think it is essential that we should write properly.
I have written a lot of stories in the term I have written a lot of stories because spelling does not slow me down so I find it quite easy .

 Sir,
Mr T says that Mr. Holbrook, our English teacher is too soft, and <ERR targ=doesn't> does'nt </ERR> teach us very good English but I don't believe one word of it, it is <ERR targ=absolutely> absolutly </ERR> nonsense, he is a good enough teacher, for any child to learn from.
We write a lot of stories but we nearly all enjoy writing them.
Mr T said it will be, be harder for us when we leave school, but if we <ERR targ=concentrate> consantrate </ERR> , and <ERR targ=listen> listern </ERR> to what we are told in English we will have no trouble when we go out into the world.
When we write stories, I think the story is much more important than the spellings, and <ERR targ=punctuation> puntuation </ERR> .
Yours faithfully Judith 

 When we have Mr Holbrook we have to write a story, and sometimes we write 4 pages or more and we plenty of the idea <ERR targ=you're> your </ERR> <ERR targ=thinking> tinking </ERR> of.

 we have to work hard, and it <ERR targ=takes> tacks </ERR> hard work to write <ERR targ=these> thoese </ERR> <ERR targ=stories> story </ERR> and it very hard when people say he soft on us .

 I think Mr T <ERR targ=should> shoold </ERR> come and see Mr.
Holbrook teaching us we do a lot of writing we have even made a <ERR targ=form> frame </ERR> magazine .
